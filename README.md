"# Security-Projects" 

This repository contains a collection of security programs written in Python language. 
The list of programs is as follows:

1. Password Generator - generates a password using random and string modules. The user is prompted to choose the password length, which must be greater than 8, and a random password will be generated using ascii letters, digits and punctuation symbols.
2. Message Encryptor - can encrypt and decrpt a message using the Fernet cryptography module. The key generated is a 44-character URL-safe base64-encoded string. Base64 is an encoding scheme that maps a group of six bits to a unique printable character, useful for transporting binary data as text (such as images inside HTML or CSS files).
